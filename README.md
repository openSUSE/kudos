# 💚 openSUSE Kudos

![kudos_live_opensuse](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcaca64d-794e-4187-bf45-5707e03ecb8f)

The **openSUSE Kudos** project brings back a bit of fun to the openSUSE community —  
and gives contributors an easy, friendly way to say **thank you** to each other.  

Because plain emails won’t do — this is about warm, peer-to-peer appreciation  
that everyone can see and celebrate, not just commits or changelogs.  

A way to recognize effort, kindness, and collaboration — from one Geeko to another.

## 🏅 Badges

All badge artwork is stored in a separate repository:  
👉 [openSUSE Kudos Badges](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos-badges)

If you’d like to propose a new badge, please open an issue there:  
🔗 [kudos-badges/issues](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos-badges/issues)

After adding or modifying a badge, update the **submodule reference** to make the changes visible in this app:

```bash
cd frontend/public/badges
git pull origin main
cd ../../..
git add frontend/public/badges
git commit -m "Update badges submodule"
```

> ℹ️ The badges repository is included as a **Git submodule**, located at  
> `frontend/public/badges/.git`

---

## 🧰 Setup & Development

Use **Distrobox** for a clean, reproducible environment.  
Then install the required tools:

```bash
distrobox enter kudos # optional to keep your system clean
zypper in jq npm
```

To clean and prepare the development setup, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos.git
./runme-clean.sh
```

> ℹ️ `runme-clean.sh` resets the environment and database, and ensures all dependencies and data are synced.

### 🪄 First Steps

Once your development environment is ready, try these steps to get familiar with Kudos:

1. **Play with the seed data**  
   The app comes with a few demo users: `klocman`, `heavencp`, `carmeleon`, `knurft` —  
   all using the password **`opensuse`**.  
   You can customize them in `backend/prisma/seed.js` before running `./runme-clean.sh`.

2. **Run two sessions**  
   - Log in as one user in your normal browser window.  
   - Open a private/incognito window and log in as another.  
   - Send kudos between them to test interactions and notifications.

3. **Try the bots**  
   Explore the `bots/` directory and test automation locally:  
   ```bash
   cd bots
   ./badger-bot-kudos -i
   ./badger-bot-manual -i -u klocman -b nuke
   ```
   > Always use the `-i` flag to ignore certificate checks when running locally.

This gives you a hands-on look at how badges are awarded, how data flows, and how bots automate recognition.

## 🌐 HTTPS on Localhost

Both the **backend (Express)** and **frontend (Vue)** run over **HTTPS** locally to support  
secure cookies and authenticated sessions.

- Backend: <https://localhost:3000>  
- Frontend (Vue): <https://localhost:5173>  
- Prisma DB admin: <http://localhost:5555>

> ⚠️ You may need to accept the self-signed certificate in your browser on first use.

## 🤖 Bots

Kudos uses several **automation bots** (that can be executed in cron or via CI) to connect with openSUSE infrastructure:

- `badger-bot-gitea` – awards badges based on Gitea activity  
- `badger-bot-kudos` – processes peer kudos submissions  
- `badger-bot-manual` – for manual or special-event badge awards  
- `badger-bot-membership` – validates openSUSE membership badges  
- `badger-bot-obs` – interacts with the Open Build Service (OBS)

Example:
```bash
cd bots
./badger-bot-kudos -i
./badger-bot-manual -i -u klocman -b nuke
```

> ⚠️ Always use the `-i` argument locally to bypass self-signed certificate errors.  
> Without it, bots won’t print or execute anything.
