## Translations

Translations for the Kudos frontend are managed via Weblate.

If you want to help translate, please go to:
https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/kudos/

- New languages require updating
  `languages.json` to have a proper flag and description in footer.

If something looks wrong or incomplete, open an issue instead of
guessing.
